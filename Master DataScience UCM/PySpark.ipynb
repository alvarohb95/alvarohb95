    "* Partiendo de `tripsTorontoTimesDF`, crear un **grafo** llamado `bikeGraph` utilizando como identificador de los vértices los identificadores de las estaciones. Construye primero un DF con todos los identificadores de las estaciones, simplemente seleccionando **from_station_id**, renombrando adecuadamente el nombre de columna. Puedes almacenar este DF en la variable `verticesDF`. También tendrás que renombrar las columnas **from_station_id** y **to_station_id** en el DF de aristas, para el que además deberás seleccionar solo dichas columnas y quitar las filas repetidas ya que solo necesitamos considerar una vez cada ruta (cada pareja de estación inicial y final). Puedes almacenar el resultado del renombramiento y la eliminación de repetidos en la variable `edgesDF`.\n",
    "* Una vez creado, aplica el algoritmo `pageRank` pasando como **ÚNICO** parámetro `maxIter = 5`, y **ningún parámetro más**. El algoritmo puede llegar a emplear más de 10 minutos. \n",
    "* Almacena el grafo devuelto por dicha función en la variable `pageRankGraph`, recupera el DF de sus vértices, ordénalo descendentemente en base a la columna `pagerank` y almacena el resultado en la variable `sortedPageRankGraphVerticesDF`\n",
    "* Obtén el identificador de la estación más relevante (con mayor valor de la métrica pageRank, que ocupará la primera fila tras la ordenación), y almacena dicho identificador en la variable `id_mas_relevante`.\n",
    "* Crea un nuevo DF de una sola fila y tres columnas llamadas `dur_media`, `dur_min` y `dur_max` con la duración **media, mínima y máxima** de los viajes de `tripsTorontoTimesDF` que **empiezan** en dicha estación (sin tener en cuenta distinción de horas o meses). **No debe usarse la función `withColumn` sino crear las columnas al vuelo con `select`**. Debe quedar almacenado en la variable `durEstMasRelevantesDF`"
